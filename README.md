# ezsign-dotnet-client-sample

This sample demonstrates how to interface to a PKCloud instance in order to generate and verify digital signatures

This example makes use of the online test instance although PKCloud can be hosted in the cloud or on your own premises

PKCloud will manage all the interfacing with HSMs, formatting of signatures and what algorithms will be used, meaning clients can maintain a crypto-agile approach - a change to the server configuration will be reflected for all clients
